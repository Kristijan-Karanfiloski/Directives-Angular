<h6>
  In Angular, structural directives are used to conditionally render content in
  the HTML based on certain conditions. Structural directives are identified by
  an asterisk (*) preceding the directive name in the HTML template. THEY CAN
  MODIFY THE DOM BUT CANT REMOVE AN ELEMENT FROM THE DOM.
